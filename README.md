# hello-world
hello world, here we go.

I like clowns and robots.  Not scary murder clowns,  but the classic circus clowns.  I like to guess how many they can fit into a car.  It makes me laugh when they get hit in the face with a creme pie.

Robots remind me of the tin man from Wizard of Oz. He was always my favorite.  Cyborgs are less interesting, but still pretty dope.  One day people will all be dead and robots will run the world.  I hope they have robot clowns to entertain themselves.
